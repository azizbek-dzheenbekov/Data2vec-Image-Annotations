# data2vec-image-annotations
 This repository contains Python code for using Data2Vec and image annotations to create a similarity metric for images based on the objects contained within them. It includes code for parsing XML files to extract object annotations, tokenizing text with a pre-trained Roberta tokenizer, and computing cosine similarity between images.

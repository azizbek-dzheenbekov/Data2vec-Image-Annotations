# Data2vec and Image Annotations

This GitHub repository demonstrates the use of Data2Vec and image annotations to create a model that can analyze and understand natural language associated with images. The repository contains Python scripts that use a pre-trained Data2VecText model to tokenize text, as well as scripts that parse through XML files to create annotations for images.

Technologies used include Python, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Transformers, and Scikit-Learn.

Contents:
- Import Libraries
- Instantiate a Data2VecText Model
- Tokenize Using Roberta Tokenizer
- Parse through XML Files to Create Annotations

This repository is suitable for anyone interested in learning about natural language processing and computer vision, as well as how Data2Vec and image annotations can be used in tandem for analysis and understanding.
